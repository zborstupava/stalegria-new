  "about.page-text" : "We live in Stupava, but many of us are from different parts of Slovakia. We feel that each one of us has received a special invitation from the Lord to join the church. Everyone has a special place there. We experience gratitude to God for the opportunity to serve at Mass with our music and singing. Our families are also an important part of the choir and support us in our ministry. We sing and play to God, our brothers and sisters with joy in our hearts.",
